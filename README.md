## 🔍 How It Works

    The app lets you create task lists, each containing multiple tasks.

    Tasks have unique IDs and include a name, description, and importance level.

    You can manage tasks and task lists through simple menu options.

    CSV import/export helps to save and load your tasks easily.

🛠️ Current Status

    Core functionality for creating and managing tasks and lists is implemented.

    Import/export CSV features are planned but not yet fully implemented.

    Marking tasks as completed and searching/filtering tasks are future improvements.
